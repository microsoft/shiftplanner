It provides the following capabilities:
- Managing Facilities and Zones
- Managing Teams (Shift Requirements)
- Managing Staff (Capabilities, Availability)
- Bookings (Booking staff, Time Off, swapping Shifts)

### Getting Started
Installation instructions are available [here](./docs/installation-guide.md). A usage guide is also available [here](./docs/getting-started.md).

### Why does it exist?
Shift Management is a global challenge for organisations. 

Rostering systems are inflexible or non-existent in many organisations forcing administrators to work with Excel or whiteboards. This is a waste of time and resources often leading to mistakes and rework.

Power Platform provides a unique ability to add a flexible layer on top of rigid systems to enable effective and efficient shift planning with new capabilities to improve the quality of life of health care workers and administrators

### How does Shift Planner fit into the Microsoft Ecosystem
Microsoft provides multiple solutions within the booking space. For simple scenarios for small teams, consider [Shifts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/what-is-shifts-f8efe6e4-ddb3-4d23-b81b-bb812296b821) for complex enterprise scenarios please consider [Dynamics 365 Universal Resource Scheduler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/common-scheduler/schedule-anything-with-universal-resource-scheduling), which is included in Dynamics 365 Field Service and Dynamics 365 for Customer Service. 

Shift Planner aims to fill the niche where Shifts provides insufficient customisability, but the large number of capabilities and flexibility provided by Universal Resource Scheduler makes the barrier to entry too steep.

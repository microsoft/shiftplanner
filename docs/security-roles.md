# Security Role descriptions
Users of the Shift Planner solution are assigned one of three security roles, each with different levels of access and permissions. The security roles are as follows:
## Shift Planner End User
This security role applies to the end user. This role grants them access to the Mobile
Canvas app, where they can view their assigned shifts, see other members’ shifts for the
option to swap shifts, and request for time-off. The role ensures that users can see their
shift details efficiently.
## Shift Planner Shift Administrator
This security role applies to the shift admin. This role grants them access to the Desktop
Canvas app, where they can manage their shift’s details and schedule. The shift
administrator can only configure their own shift, including creating and updating their shift
team and its team positions, and adding and updating resources to the shift. The role
provides visibility into their shift’s schedule and requests, and the privileges to approve or
deny their resources’ requests for time-off and swapping shifts.
## Shift Planner Administrator
This security role applies to the shift admin. This role grants them access to both the
Model-driven app and the Desktop Canvas app, where they can manage the entire data
model and configure the shift schedule. This includes setting up facilities and their zones,
shift types, roles, email notification templates, and creating and updating shift teams, team
positions, and shift bookings. It also provides visibility into all shifts, teams, and user
requests. This role provides full privileges for comprehensive management of all referential
data and ensures its accuracy and completeness.
